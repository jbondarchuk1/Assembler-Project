# Assembler-Project
Hey! So I built this project as part of the Nand2Tetris course. It's an assembler for a real computer (the Hack computer) that parses the Hack assembly .asm files into Hack machine language (16 bit binary) .hack files.

The first 2 files, pong.asm and pong.hack are the assembly and machine language files respectively. Assembler.py is a Python based version of the assembler and the AssemInstruc.py file is a helper file
